            <p>Hey! I'm Brian (he/him). I am a user experience developer based out of Milwaukee, WI. I strive to build inclusive and accessible websites, and enjoy experimenting with and fine-tuning design systems. I am currently looking for a new role, and also patiently waiting for <code>:has()</code> to be supported on all browsers.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy woodworking, traveling, and not talking about myself.</p>
